				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>podzZz</b> is a nap pod and mobile app that integrates audio, haptic, olfactory, and visual features to help college students de-stress. Targeted towards Purdue University students for its initial launch, we designed the pod to be placed in multiple locations on campus and accessible at all times a day.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h2>Project details</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Role</b>: UX design
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Date</b>: October 2018
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Duration</b>: 9 weeks
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Team size</b>: 6 members
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
                In this project, I worked closely with five students and took the lead in user research and mobile app design.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h2>Research</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				We began the project with a <b>contextual inquiry study</b> at Wilmeth Active Learning Center, a popular study spot for Purdue students. We took note on general student behavior regarding sleep and study habits. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We also conducted a <b>comparative analysis</b> to understand the scope of solutions for sleep deprivation. Products included various sleep apps like Sleep Cycle and Relax Melodies, wearbles like eye masks, headphones, pillows, and weighted blankets, and nap pods.
            </p>
            <p>
                These methods helped us understand student sleep and study habits, in which we identified key insights:
			</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Lack of quality sleep is rampant among college students due to class workload, social events, and jobs
					</li>
					<li>
                        Several students appeared to be napping in study spaces as a result of not having enough time to go home
					</li>
                    <li>
                        Sleep products are not typically targeted towards college students
                    </li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h5>Significance</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				With these insights in mind, we created personas to empathize with our user group and fully understand their pain points.

				<h5>Design considerations</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				Reviewing our personas' experiences, we identified design considerations to be addressed:
			</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<b>Cost</b>: students often do not have disposable income
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Time</b>: students' busy schedules do not provide time for prolonged rest or relaxation
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Accessibility</b>: all students should be able to access sleep solutions with convenience
                    </li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h2>Ideation</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				Reviewing our design considerations and persona pain points, we narrowed our ideation to focus on <b>naps</b>, as the problem of finding a quiet and comfortable place to rest amid a busy day was a recurring theme among our user group. Therefore, we storyboarded napping-on-campus scenarios for students: 
            </p>
            <p>
				<img src="img/podzzz/storyboard.png">
			</p>
			<p>
				<h5>
					Proposal
				</h5>
			</p>			
			<p>
				We arrived at the solution of a <b>sensory nap pod</b>, podzZz, to be placed in multiple campus locations and offer fatigued students slight reprieve from their busy schedules. A quick 15-30 minute power nap would rejuvenate students' energy without disrupting their schedules or cause them to leave campus between classes or work.
            <p>
                Additionally, as we found most nap pods to offer a place to rest and listen to music in our research, we ideated on implementing <b>audio, haptic, olfactory, and visual features</b> within the pod to create an immersive, sleep-inducing experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h5>
                    User flow
                </h5>
            </p>
            <p>
                We realized that users needed a way to control the sensory settings of the pod, and what better way to do so than through their personal devices? So, via Bluetooth connection, <b>users' phones act as a remote control for the pod</b> to customize all their sensory needs. This user flow demonstrates the progression of our cross-channel solution from a scheduled or walk-in perspective.

                Through a Bluetooth pairing with their phone, users can select a variety of features in the pod that target the senses for an immersive, sleep-inducing experience:
                
            
                
                
            </p>
            <p>
            <ul>
					<li>
						<b>Visual</b>: Boiler Nap includes a monitor on the roof of the pod for users to view ocean waves, fluttering leaves, forest rainfall, and more to drift off to
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Audio</b>: Users can fall asleep to a birds singing, white noise, coffeeshop ambience, and other sounds through pod speakers
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Haptic</b>: Stress balls, fidget cubes, and other stress-relieving tangibles are provided in the pod for users to wind down with
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Olfactory</b>: Diffusers within the pod emit lavender, eucalyptus, vanilla, and other scents for maximum relaxation
					</li>
				</ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Users can also play their own audio or video through phone-pod connection if they desire. Additionally, users can opt to not use any features for a more quiet and simple experience.

					Final thoughts
				</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				Cabin was the first project I designed for without using any screens or mobile app. Constraining my design thinking to not include an app was definitely a challenge, as I'm forced to work within the confines of essentially a toy house. In the context of bridging long-distance families together though, I now feel like the absence of screen technology is <i>more</i> meaningful than what can be created throurgh an app, or even a video call. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I experienced how frustrating finding representative from such a niche user group was in this project, as none of the people in our extended networks could reach more than one actual truck driver, which made usability testing our prototypes for sizing and features astronomically more difficult.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also wanted to explore a model <b>truck</b> for the family's end. If the trucker receives a model house that's reactive to his/her home, the family should receive a reactive model of their truck driver's truck. We were actually halfway through design and prototyping of this concept, but were too time-constrained to sufficiently test and develop it further.
